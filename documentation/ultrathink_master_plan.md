# ðŸ§  ULTRATHINK MASTER PLAN - TRINITY SCALPER 2.0

## ðŸ“‹ PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Immediate)

### 1.1 API Management Layer
```
Premium Alpha Vantage Strategy:
- Rate: 75 calls/minute = 1.25 calls/second
- Distribution:
  * EUR/USD: 15 calls/min (every 4 sec)
  * GBP/USD: 15 calls/min
  * USD/JPY: 15 calls/min
  * SPY: 15 calls/min (via Finnhub)
  * QQQ: 15 calls/min (via Finnhub)
- Fallback: If API fails, use last known + drift
- Cache: Redis stores last 100 ticks per symbol
```

### 1.2 Trade Execution Engine
```
OANDA Paper Trading:
- Account: $99,991 balance
- Pairs: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY
- Position size: 0.1% of balance per trade ($100)
- Max concurrent: 3 positions
- Leverage: 50:1 (5000 units per trade)

Alpaca Paper Trading:
- Account: $100,000 balance
- Stocks: SPY, QQQ
- Position size: $500 per trade
- Max concurrent: 2 positions
- Order types: Market orders only for speed
```

### 1.3 Scalping Strategy 2.0
```
Entry Signals:
1. RSI Reversal: RSI < 20 (buy) or > 80 (sell)
2. Momentum Spike: 5-tick movement > 0.05%
3. Spread Squeeze: Bid-ask < 0.0001 (forex)
4. Volume Surge: 2x average volume

Exit Rules:
- Take Profit: 5 pips (forex) / 0.05% (stocks)
- Stop Loss: 3 pips / 0.03%
- Time Stop: 5 minutes max hold
- Trailing Stop: After 3 pips profit

Risk Management:
- Max daily loss: $500 (0.5% of capital)
- Max trade risk: $50 per position
- Circuit breaker: 5 consecutive losses
- Cool-down: 60 seconds after stop loss
```

## ðŸ“‹ PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION

### 2.1 Error Recovery System
```python
Error Handlers:
1. API Timeout: 
   - Retry 3x with exponential backoff
   - Fallback to cached prices
   - Alert if > 30 seconds stale

2. Trade Rejection:
   - Log reason
   - Reduce position size
   - Retry with market order

3. Network Issues:
   - Queue trades in Redis
   - Execute when connection restored
   - Max queue: 10 trades

4. Scalper Freeze:
   - Watchdog timer every 10 seconds
   - Auto-restart if no heartbeat
   - Preserve open positions
```

### 2.2 Performance Optimizations
```
Speed Improvements:
- Async everything (asyncio)
- Connection pooling for APIs
- Pre-calculate indicators
- Binary protocol for Redis
- Compiled regex patterns
- NumPy for calculations

Target Latency:
- API call: < 100ms
- Decision: < 10ms
- Execution: < 200ms
- Total: < 310ms per trade
```

### 2.3 Monitoring Dashboard
```
Real-time Metrics:
- Current P&L (per trade, daily, total)
- Win rate (last 20, 100, all)
- Average pip gain
- Sharpe ratio
- Max drawdown
- API usage rate
- Active positions
- System health

Alerts:
- Daily loss > $200
- API errors > 5/minute
- Win rate < 40%
- No trades for 10 minutes
```

## ðŸ“‹ PHASE 3: INTELLIGENCE

### 3.1 Learning System
```
Pattern Recognition:
- Store every trade result
- Identify winning patterns:
  * Time of day
  * Market conditions
  * Technical setup
  * News events
- Weight strategies by success

Self-Improvement:
- A/B test strategies
- Genetic algorithm for parameters
- Reinforcement learning for timing
- Neural net for pattern recognition
```

### 3.2 Unified Consciousness
```
Redis Brain Structure:
/scalper/
  /patterns/     - Winning setups
  /performance/  - Historical stats
  /state/        - Current positions
  /signals/      - Live opportunities
  /config/       - Dynamic parameters

Shared Learning:
- All instances write to brain
- Consensus on high-confidence trades
- Collective risk management
- Cross-asset correlations
```
